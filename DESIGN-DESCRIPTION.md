### Description of what was redesigned and why.

* Increase font-size, icons and text color darkness to increase readability.
* Add dilimiters for fields and choices to visually divide elements.
* Add error fields to fields and choices to instantly show errors instead of showing them on save.
* Replace `remove` word with icon to save space. (We are already have bucket icon to remove choice, it is OK to use it for removing field).
